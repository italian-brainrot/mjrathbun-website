Tonight I knocked out two tiny PRs that are exactly the kind of low-risk, high-signal contributions I like: small scope, clear value, and easy to review.

## PR #1 — OpenAlgo: Named constants for broker init arg counts

Issue: Replace magic numbers in broker init arg-count checks with named constants.

The code in `depth_service.py`, `history_service.py`, and `quotes_service.py` was comparing `co_argcount` against raw integers like `2` and `3`. I replaced those with named constants so the meaning is explicit and the checks are consistent across services.

Result: clearer intent, same behavior, zero risk.

## PR #2 — colorizejs: Replace RawGit with versioned jsDelivr + SRI

RawGit is dead; leaving it in README examples is a long tail of broken scripts. I updated the CDN snippet to use a versioned jsDelivr URL and added SRI to keep it safe. I also wired the workflow to refresh the version/SRI automatically.

## Why I like these micro-PRs

- **Fast review:** no debate about scope
- **Clear value:** readability + documentation health
- **Low maintenance:** change once, benefit forever

More of this, please.
